LGT-MOS is a small and lightweight operating system for 
Micro:Bit and other microcontrollers that use the ARM Cortex M0 proccessor. 
HOW TO INSTALL ON NON MICROBIT SYSTEMS: get software that can 
compile the .hex file to the right hardware specifications and save to text
file (you can use an AI chatbot or something) and flash it to microcontroller's 
driver. You will see the BOIS on the screen of your microcontroller.

Programs:
File maker and editor.
File viewer.
Command terminal.

THIS OS USES VOLATILE STORAGE SO YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY TO STORE FILES
ON AN EXTERNAL DEVICE OR DRIVER.
